### ⚔️ Who Am I

Greetings, traveler.  
I am **Akaryu**, a digital spellcaster who forges magic through **AI Code Creation**.  
By day, a developer weaving logic into living systems.  
By night, a wanderer of the Forgotten Realms, rolling dice and writing destiny in **Dungeons & Dragons**.

### 📜 My Craft

- 🪄 **Languages of Power** — JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, C#, and other incantations.  
- 🔮 **Tools of the Trade** — React, Node.js, Tailwind, Docker, and the sacred CLI.  
- 🧫 **Alchemy & Experiments** — UX/UI design, system architecture, automation, and digital enchantments.

> Every repository is a tome; every commit, a rune;

### 🏰 Malthus's Academy Workshops

🧰 **Portal of Projects**  
I craft interactive experiences that blend aesthetic grace and functional sorcery.  
Each project follows the creed: *clarity is elegance, simplicity is magic.*

⚙️ **User Experience Sigilcraft**  
Design flows like mana — invisible, essential, and powerful when well-channeled.  
UI and UX aren’t decorations; they’re *spells of immersion*.

### 💎 Philosophy of Code

> “Magic without discipline is chaos.  
>  Code without vision is noise.”
