# wizardakaryu

Welcome to the wizardakaryu repository — a personal collection of projects, experiments, and utilities by @wizardakaryu.

This repository acts as a central hub for small projects, demos, scripts, and learning experiments. Some folders may be standalone projects with their own README and build instructions. Use this top-level README to get oriented and find the project you want to explore.

## About

This repo contains multiple, possibly unrelated, projects and experiments. They can range from quick scripts and one-off utilities to more developed projects. Each project may have its own language, toolchain, and dependencies.

If you found this repository and want to use or extend something, check the subfolder for a project-specific README. If none exists, the instructions below will help you get started.

---

## Repository structure

A typical layout you might find in this repo:

- /project-a/ — a standalone project (may include its own README)
- /project-b/ — another project or experiment
- /scripts/ — useful utility scripts
- /docs/ — documentation or notes
- README.md — this top-level overview

Replace or extend these entries with the actual folders in the repository to make this README specific to the work here.

---

## Notable projects

List the main/active projects here with short descriptions. Example:

- project-one — short description of what it does and the primary language/runtime
- project-two — short description and link to the subfolder or README
- scripts — small utilities used for maintenance or automation

If you want, I can enumerate the actual projects and generate per-project READMEs — tell me which folder to focus on.

---

## Getting started

These general steps will help you get a local copy of the repository and run or inspect projects.

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/wizardakaryu/wizardakaryu.git
2. Change into the repository:
   cd wizardakaryu
3. Inspect the folders and open the README inside any project folder for specific setup instructions.

---

## Prerequisites

Depending on the project you want to work with, you may need one or more of:

- Git
- Node.js (and npm/yarn)
- Python (and pip/venv)
- Go toolchain
- Docker
- Other language-specific toolchains

Check the project folder for exact requirements.

---

## Installing and running projects

Each project should include its own instructions. Typical examples:

Node.js
- cd project-one
- npm install
- npm run start

Python
- cd project-two
- python -m venv .venv
- source .venv/bin/activate
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- python main.py

Go
- cd project-three
- go build
- ./project-three

If a project is missing a README or start instructions, I can add one for that project — let me know which folder to document.

---

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Suggested process:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch:
   git checkout -b feature/my-feature
3. Commit your changes:
   git commit -m "Add some feature"
4. Push and open a pull request

Please include clear descriptions and, when relevant, tests or reproducible steps. Open issues for bugs or feature requests.

## Next steps / Customization

- If you want this README committed to the repository, I can create or update the README.md in the repo.
- If you prefer a README tailored to a specific project folder, tell me which folder (for example: `project-a/`) and I will generate a focused README with setup, usage, and examples.
- I can also add a LICENSE, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, CONTRIBUTING guide, or generate per-project badges and CI templates on request.
